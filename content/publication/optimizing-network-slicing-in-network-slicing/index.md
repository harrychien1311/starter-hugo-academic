abstract: Network slicing is a key technology in 5G and beyond networks to meet
  the diverse requirements of various applications. The resource usage
  forecasting in network slicing plays an important role in helping network
  operators scale network slices up and down accurately and timely to avoid
  Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations signed with network tenants.
  Therefore, we propose a Long Shot-term memory (LSTM)-based forecasting
  algorithm utilizing multivariate time series data to predict the future
  resource usage of virtual machines (VMs) in network slices. Through
  comprehensive experiments, our proposed algorithm outperforms other
  state-of-the-arts forecasting algorithms only processing univariate time
  series data in both short-term prediction and long-term prediction to help
  network operator reduce the costs of SLA violation and resource
  overprovisioning.
