abstract: Cloud computing is currently considered the most cost-effective
  platform for offering business and consumer IT services over the Internet.
  However, it is prone to new vulnerabilities. A new type of attack called an
  economic denial of sustainability (EDoS) attack exploits the pay-per-use model
  to scale up the resource usage over time to the extent that the cloud user has
  to pay for the unexpected usage charge. To prevent EDoS attacks, a few
  solutions have been proposed, including hard-threshold and machine
  learning-based solutions. Among them, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
  solutions achieve much higher accuracy and false-alarm rates than
  hard-threshold and other machine learning-based solutions. However, LSTM
  requires a long sequence length of the input data, leading to a degraded
  performance owing to increases in the calculations, the detection time, and
  consuming a large number of computing resources of the defense system. We,
  therefore, propose a two-phase deep learning-based EDoS detection scheme that
  uses an LSTM model to detect each abnormal flow in network traffic; however,
  the LSTM model requires only a short sequence length of five of the input
  data. Thus, the proposed scheme can take advantage of the efficiency of the
  LSTM algorithm in detecting each abnormal flow in network traffic, while
  reducing the required sequence length of the input data. A comprehensive
  performance evaluation shows that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing
  solutions in terms of accuracy and resource consumption
