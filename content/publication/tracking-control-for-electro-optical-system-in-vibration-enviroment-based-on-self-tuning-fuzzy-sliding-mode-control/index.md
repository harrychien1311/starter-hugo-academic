  The paper presents a new method for tracking control of EOTS (Electro-Optical
  Tracking

  System) operating in mobile environment such as ship, air plane, tank and so on. This makes the

  base body of the EOTS has angular motion. The control alogorithm used in this paper is adaptive

  fuzzy sliding mode. The overall control is built and simulated in Matlab and compared with a sliding

  mode controller and a conventional PID controller. The simulation result illustrated the effectiveness

  of the proposed controller.
