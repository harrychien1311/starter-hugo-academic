title: "ID management system leveraging Blockchain and IoT technology "

summary: >-
  

  In this project, we want to build an application can manage the identification (ID) of users who check-in at public places such as hotels, airports, buildings,... Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain framework are two core technologies used in this project. Every time users visit a public place, they do check-in process by the application installed in an embedded device (such as mobile phones). The application scans their face and requires some basic information such as name, purpose of visit, ... and add their check-in information to a blockchain-based database as a new block. If some special organizations such as government or police want to check the history check-in of a user for a special purpose, they can query this information from the application. Because the data written to a blockchain-based database cannot be changed, the information queried from the application can be authenticated.

1. Summarize of the project: In this project, we want to build an application can manage the identification (ID) of users who check-in at public places such as hotels, airports, buildings,... Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain framework are two core technologies used in this project. Every time users visit a public place, they do check-in process by the application installed in an embedded device (such as mobile phones). The application scans their face and requires some basic information such as name, purpose of visit, ... and add their check-in information to a blockchain-based database as a new block. If some special organizations such as government or police want to check the history check-in of a user for a special purpose, they can query this information from the application. Because the data written to a blockchain-based database cannot be changed, the information queried from the application can be authenticated.
2. Technologies and Tools used: Hyperledger Fabric blochain framework, IoT Watson framework, Java Script
3. Main responsibilities: Design and implement the blockchain network, develop Restful API for the blockchain network.
4. We can share the design document of the demo version of the application
